# Haskellorls

Haskell implementation of [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) flavored GNU ls.

The goal of this project is to create a software which has GNU ls compatiblities about options and output.
In addition, maybe have some options and colored output which exa has as long as keeping above compatiblities.

## NOTE

`Haskellorls` means Color ls with Haskell.

This is a joke software created by a beginner.
